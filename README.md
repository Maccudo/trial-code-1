# trial-code-1
The RuntimeError Traceback file is the complete error file as you menntion

The celeba.zip file is the dataset i am using for the training now - set of grayscale images

code_trial.py is the python exutable file in .py

trial_code.ipynb is the same file as above but in jupyter notebook

Note: I am using python 3.7 using pytorch library (latest version)
